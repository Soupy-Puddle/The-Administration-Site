Backup generators were not yet installed when the power outage occurred meaning there was no way of supplying the islands with electricity.<br><br>None of the lights function, making the night more dangerous, and resulting in some more minor inconveniences. Buildings that make no use of natural light as well as underground buildings are incredibly difficult to traverse, practically impossible without a light source like a torch. Torches in turn are now being used a lot more predominately, as it is the only available light source you can use to traverse through the night or dark places.<br>At the moment of writing this report, no one has been seriously injured due to the lack of light.<br><br>The trains, which are the only safe transport between the islands, are out of service due to the power lines not being supplied with sufficient energy.<br>Anyone on one of the trains during the outage has not been heard since then, leading to assume they have died in one way or another. Further information on their status will be noted in future reports.<br><br>Alongside all that, the shutting down of the trains and the inability to use further means of communication since the outage has resulted in silence from all connected islands. Communication has become impossible and further coordination is not possible.<br>How to proceed under these circumstances very likely differs from island to island.<br><br>Doors powered by electricity are no longer usable. Many restricted areas are fully closed off now, unable to be opened. This resulted in multiple people being stuck behind them.<br>The doors will only open once the power is back on, the fate of the People stuck is unknown. While at the beginning, the voices of those stuck could be heard when trying to talk to them, many of them have fallen silent. <br>This leads to the belief that the people behind the doors are reserving their energy or have by now died, most likely of dehydration or starvation.<br>Further information on their status will be noted in future reports."},{id:2,title:"#023-Corp/Med-Int-NOT-1123",tags:"Corpse, Medicine",body:"HOURS AFTER THE CLONE WAS ALIVE, IT DIED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT OXYGEN IN THE LUNGS.

There are still a few months before residents arrive on the island chain. However, applications for residency have been pouring in and maintenance has become increasingly necessary on some of the central hub island\u2019s \u201Colder\u201D portions. <br><br>The location which [REDACTED] was tasked with checking up on was fairly standard, an old boiler room located in the underbelly of the main hub island. According to workers who had recently been tasked with overseeing the boiler room, either for security purposes or to perform maintenance on it, the area had been purveyed with a thick musk. The smell is as of yet unidentified, but theories as to its origin are deeply entwined with the following incident.<br><br>After receiving the email, [REDACTED] accidentally left their phone in the breakroom on the main hub island (as revealed by camera footage reviewed post-incident). This is likely why they didn\u2019t receive the follow-up email stating that the previous email was accidentally sent and that no maintenance was needed in that area.<br><br>Upon entering the boiler room REDACTED was greeted by an unfortunate sight. One of the old\u2026 what was it, \u201CAdministrative Units\u201D from another TA site was roaming the hallway. While it has now been identified as tampering, at the time REDACTED assumed that the Unit was placed there to monitor the location.

What happened to me wasn\u2019t because of drugs. I didn\u2019t take any drugs. I swear. That\u2019s just what you\u2019re all saying to ignore what I went through! I missed my daughter\u2019s birthday because of this and you want to just chalk it up to Becker relapsing?\u201D<br><br>The subject pauses and takes a deep breath.<br><br>\u201CSorry, sorry, I know you\u2019ve heard it enough. On Valentine\u2019s Day, I went to sleep in bed with my wife, as normal. And when I woke up something was wrong. I don\u2019t know what but it was something. When I went to get my morning coffee I noticed that it was already 11. I thought it was strange that I overslept, I never take days off for granted. Well, by the time the pot was ready, I noticed it was 3 in the afternoon. Something wasn\u2019t adding up. I checked my clock to make sure it wasn\u2019t moving too fast for some reason.\u201D<br><br>\u201CNope. It was fine. The worst part is that while I was checking my clock it kept ticking. By the time I had mounted it back on the wall, it was 1 in the morning.\u201D<br><br>\u201CI called out from work the next morning. Well, once I had finished banging my head against the wall trying to figure out what the hell was wrong. I don\u2019t like to admit this but I may have screamed at the lady who manages the phone lines.\u201D<br><br>\u201CBy the time I actually saw another person 5 days had passed. It had only been what I could assume an hour or two. My wife and daughter were\u2026 not on base for some reason. So the first person I saw was my manager. He explained to me that I couldn\u2019t keep missing work and that I was already on probation. I pleaded with him to understand that there was something wrong. Time wasn\u2019t working right. He called me crazy and a lazy ass. Afterward, I walked home.\u201D<br><br>The statement giver begins to cry at this point.<br><br>\u201CWhen I got home was the next time I saw someone. My wife she.. She asked where I had been. She asked why I missed our daughter\u2019s birthday. She asked if I had been abusing substances again. I said that I hadn\u2019t, and I hadn\u2019t. It was then she served me the divorce papers. I had been\u2026 gone for about two weeks without a word.\u201D
      <br><br>\u201COne day it just stopped. It had been\u2026 a day. For me, at least. I was staring down my watch, waiting for it to just move normally. And then it did. And now you all don\u2019t believe me. I don\u2019t even know where you all expected me to find substances in this compound. Bunch of bullshit.\u201D
